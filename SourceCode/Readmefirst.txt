MAKE A 2D RPG IN A WEEKEND SOURCE CODE README
Darrin Perez

This source code folder contains the entirety of the game created for the Make A 2D RPG In A Weekend book,
within a RMVXA project file. The full version of RPG Maker VX Ace must be installed on your computer to
open this project file.

Important things to note:

- The game as created in Chapters 1 through 9 is located in the series of maps under the Eagle's Crossing
and Dungeon sections. You can see the individual maps to see how events should be laid out.

- The RMVXA project file also contains blank versions of each of the six levels of the game's dungeon.
You are free to use them to accelerate your own progress in creating the game.

- All relevant scripts can be found within the Materials section of the Script Editor. Likewise, you can find
just about everything else covered within the book inside the Database.

- The Chapter 10 exercises are used within the following maps:
 - The Bazaar: Lower-right corner of the Eagle's Crossing map which contains two otherwise inaccessible NPCs.
The example shop is the NPC located at 22,18, and the full bazaar is the NPC located at 22,21.
 - A Portal Appears: Portal Test map in the project file.
 - Using the Portal: Bonus Dungeon map.
 - A Random Portal: Portal Test 2 map.
 - Handling Random Encounters with Common Events: Bonus Dungeon map.
 - Another Way to Randomize Chests: A single chest located at 32,13 of the Portal Test 2 map.
 - Day-Night Cycle: Cycle map in the project file.
 - Random Encounters in a Day-Night Cycle: Cycle map.
 - Achievements: Dungeon map in the project file.

You can playtest the Chapter 10 events by changing the start location of the player in the project file to
the relevant map. 
On that note, holding the Ctrl key while running a playtest will allow you to pass otherwise impassable
terrain.
